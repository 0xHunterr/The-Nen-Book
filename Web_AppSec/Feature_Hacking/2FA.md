## 2FA Code is Not Updated After New Code is Requested
```
1. Try Login to your account
2. In 2FA Request resend the code
3. If the old and new code is the same then there is an issue
Impact: code that is not updated after a request new one makes it easier for a hacker to brute force or guess the code
