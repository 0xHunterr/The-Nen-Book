## Web App Enum

Web App Enum refers to the process of identifying and categorizing different components and functionalities of a web application, such as pages, forms, input fields, buttons, and links, in order to assess its security posture and potential vulnerabilities.

we can use `wappalyzer` extension to know the tech of the web app (the OS on which the app is running on , the web server, the Programming language and sometimes the database server ) OR  using command line tool `whatweb`

it’s important to know which database service the app using in order to know it u have to fuzz the app so it replies u with an error 

As we speak about fuzzing, let’s fuzz the application to know what directories and files it has we will use wfuzz :

```bash
wefuzz -c -z file,usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt --hc 404,301,302 http://example.com/FUZZ
```

or using GUI tool like dirbuster
