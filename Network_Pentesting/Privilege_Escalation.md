# Privilege Escalation

first thing we need know which user we are currently using by commands: **whoami** and **net user** to get more details(Windows ) and on linux we can use id command for more details or reading passwd file

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

then we need know which machine we are on and what it can do so we can check itâ€™s name by **hostname** command in both linux and Windows

but we need more info about the OS and Kernal so we will use **systeminfo(Windows)** command what concern us here is **(OS Name,OS Version,System Type)**

```bash
systeminfo
```

in Linux use **uname -a** 

```bash
uname -a
or 
cat /etc/issue
```

## Network Enum

Ok so now we know some info about the OS then we start to look for running processes in order to find any process that u can deal with and at the same it uses higher privileges on Windows :

```powershell
tasklist /svc
```

*it shows u the procesess that are running on the same account not the higher priv*

on linux :

```bash
ps aux
```

since we control a machine in internal network we need to scan the network for new interesting hosts or ports and perform pivoting 

in windows :

```bash
ipconfig /all
```

```

```
