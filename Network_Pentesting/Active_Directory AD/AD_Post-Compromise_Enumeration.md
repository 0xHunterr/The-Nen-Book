- We have compromised a user account as we get FrankCastle user and it’s hash ( with Responder) and crack it and get on Machines using SMB relay **without getting the hash** and we able to **dump SAM file and collect hashes in that way after we have compromise the next it to enumerate the network using compromises .**
- **PowerView tool (Power shell tool) :** allows us to look at the network and to enumerate basically the domain controller , domain policy and etc.
- **Bloodhound tool :** visualize what is going in the network and where we can find sensitive user that might be log in and where we can find **shortest path to get the domain admin.**

## **PowerView**

- **Download the tool :**

- **Useful Resource for powerview :**
    
    [Active Directory Enumeration With PowerView](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Ow_LKanMo)
    
- Running powerview from directly any windows machine we have , for attacker situation if he has access to a shell then we ‘ll use that shell and **we ‘re going to load powershell.**
- **Bypass execution policy using powershell - Ready for executing scripts :**

## **Bloodhound**

- **Download Invoke-Bloodhound :**
    
    [powershell/SharpHound.ps1 at master · puckiestyle/powershell](https://github.com/puckiestyle/powershell/blob/master/SharpHound.ps1)
    
- Download a data of AD ( when we are on a machine or network ) and visualize data on the graph.
- Run a tool called neo4j and we should to set it up - change default credentials- Go to local host to change default password for more security :
    
    ![220.jpg](../../../Media/network-pentesting/Post-Compromise%20Enumeration%20813a068ae3574542a01a4397876b0d0d/220.jpg)
    
- **Invoke-Bloodhound :** power shell tool using for grabbing data - Downloading this file on Windows 10 machines ( which you get access from previous stage).
    - **To be able to use scripts :**
        
        ![221.jpg](../../../Media/network-pentesting/Post-Compromise%20Enumeration%20813a068ae3574542a01a4397876b0d0d/221.jpg)
        
    - **Running sharphound :**
        
        ![22.jpg](../../../Media/network-pentesting/Post-Compromise%20Enumeration%20813a068ae3574542a01a4397876b0d0d/22.jpg)
        
    - **Running the script to get data collection from specific domain - Get this file copied to kali machine  :**
        
        ![222.jpg](../../../Media/network-pentesting/Post-Compromise%20Enumeration%20813a068ae3574542a01a4397876b0d0d/222.jpg)
        
- Now we have our data transferred from our windows machine ( we get in the last phase) to Bloodhound - Processing all json file  :
    
    ![223.jpg](../../../Media/network-pentesting/Post-Compromise%20Enumeration%20813a068ae3574542a01a4397876b0d0d/223.jpg)
    
    - Here we find out the shortest path to Domain admins . Here , we should have session on the punisher machine **which has it local admin and this will lead us to DOMAIN ADMINS @MARVEL.LOCAL ( our domain admin) + Have session now unlike spiderman machine. [ Token impersenation ] .**
- We always do enumeration after each step and ask what information is here for us after we got access we enumerate and still in this cycle as every step you do , you have more information to know about.
- After compromising one account what can we do with that account?
