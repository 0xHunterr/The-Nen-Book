**MITRE Engenuity** is a distinct entity within the larger MITRE Corporation, focuses on the development and management of the ATT&CK Framework, we can consider it as a trusted environment for organizations to collaborate, share knowledge, and develop cutting-edge solutions to tackle emerging cybersecurity challenges.

This collaborative approach allows the group to continuously improve the ATT&CK Framework, ensuring that it remains relevant and effective in addressing the evolving threat landscape

some Terminologies u know are: **CVE**,  short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.
What about the ATT&CK Framework? The longer name for this flashy acronym is Adversarial
Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge.

These are two examples of the major contributions the non-profit MITRE Corporation has made to the world of cyber security.

We know that **MITRE** does a lot more than **ATT&CK**, but we will focusing on the ATT&CK Framework. Therefore, we should look more closely at the group within MITRE that is responsible for all things ATT&CK. That group is **MITRE Engenuity** 

## **Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID)**

The Center for Threatâ€“Informed Defense is a non-profit, privately funded research and

development organization operated by MITRE Engenuity

### The CTID conducts research in several areas, including:

- framework to new technology domains such as cloud computing.
- Identifying and researching new ways to thwart ATT&CK techniques across the Protect, Detect, and Respond stages of defense
- Measuring evolving adversary behavior, such as creating a "top-techniques" calculator that lists adversary techniques that are most likely to impact your organization.

All research and development outputs from the CTID are made globally available to maximize their impact.

### **ATT&CK Evaluations**

ATT&CK Evaluations are a critical component of the ATT&CK, aimed at assessing the effectiveness of various cybersecurity solutions in detecting and mitigating real-world threats.

By simulating the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of known adversaries, these evaluations provide a unique opportunity for security vendors and practitioners to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of their products and services.

### **Objective and Transparent Evaluation Process**

MITRE Engenuity's ATT&CK Evaluations focus on providing an objective and transparent assessment of cybersecurity solutions.

They do not rank or rate products but instead offer a comprehensive analysis of how each solution performs against specific adversary behaviors. 

This allows organizations to make informed decisions when selecting or optimizing
their cybersecurity tools and strategies.


> [!ðŸ’¡ So how do they evaluating the solutions?]
>
> **Key Components of the Evaluations:**
> â€¢ Adversary Emulation: The evaluations simulate real-world attacks by mimicking the TTPs of known adversaries. This helps to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity solutions detecting and mitigating actual threats.
> 
> â€¢ ATT&CK Framework: The evaluations utilize the ATT&CK Framework as a common language to describe adversary behaviors, allowing for a standardized and consistent evaluation process.
> 
> â€¢ Collaboration: The evaluation process is transparent and encourages collaboration among vendors, practitioners, and the cybersecurity community at large. All findings and results are publicly shared to drive continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.

### **Benefits of the ATT&CK Evaluations:**

- Informed Decision-Making: By providing objective and detailed insights into the performance of cybersecurity solutions, the evaluations help organizations make informed decisions about the tools and strategies that best meet their unique needs.
- Continuous Improvement: The evaluations serve as a catalyst for vendors to improve their products and services, as they identify gaps and areas for enhancement.
- Industry Collaboration
